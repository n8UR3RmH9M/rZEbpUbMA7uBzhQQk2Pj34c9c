# IAM Governance

# Physical and Logical Access Controls

### Access to Networks

Wired vs Wireless

Remote access

node authentication

- certificate
- TMP

### Access to Applications

- Passwords
- Called Modules
- Session Hijacking
- Logging - who,what change, Time Date

### Access to Data

- Encryption
- Database views
- Obfuscation/Masking
- Tokenization
- Screen Filters

---

### Protection of Information Assets

Reports

- Distribution
- Labeling
- Storage
- Shredding

### Protection on Portable Media

Start with

# Identification and Authentication

are the basis of establishing access permissions and accountability

![Untitled](IAM%20Governance%20f3a532f447a64d53995ef733cc120e9c/Untitled.png)

## Key Concepts

Separation of Duties - Enforced through:

- Mutual exclusivity
- Dual control
- Roles

Bypassed by collusion

- Job rotation
- Mandatory vacations

### The Identify Lifecycle

1. Provision Access
2. Manage Access
3. Remove Access
4. Review access logs

Who get access is determine by the ASSET OWNER

Security Manager provide advice to the system owner

### Traceability

Identity and access management manages and tracks all access to systems

- Provisioning
- Logging
- Auditing trails

### Identification

Claim of unique identifier

- Account number
- Employee number
- Customer number
- Government issued Identifier
- Email Address
- User identifier/userId

### Proofing of Identity

- Establish ownership of the identify
    - Secret question
- Password resets
- Modification to permissions
- Renewal of certificates

### Key Points

Compliance with regulations, and the ability to conduct an investigation, requires the ability to associate all activity with a defined, unique identity.

# Authentication

is the validation of the identity

Verify, validate, prove the identity

- Proof of possession
- Secret question

What you:

- Know
    - Static values - password,passphrase,secret question
    - Subject to replay attack
    - Should be changed on a periodic basis
- Have
    - Employee id badge
    - Token
    - Smartcard
        - Dynamic, one-time password
    - Synchronous, asynchronous
        - Time or event
        - Challenge response
- Are
    - Biometrics
        - Behavioral
            - Voice print
            - Signature dynamics
            - Keystroke dynamics
        - Physiological Biometrics
            - Iris Scan
            - Retina Scan
            - Palm Print
            - Fignerprint
            - Facial Recognition
    
    - issue with user concern on privacy,cleanliness,Delay in processing,cost maintenance / registration
    
    ### Node Authentication
    
    Authentication based on device:
    
    - IP Address
    - MAC
    - RFID
